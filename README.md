# Full-Stack-The-Desk-Application
Requirement for the project is to complete the code and the fix the bugs and to generate correct output.
The existing code had the options selection added each time, it is called, moved the adding of expense functionality to the main, Moved-
--the expense array list as a static so that it can be accessed throughout the code.
The existing code used for and if around the switch statement , as it was redundant, removed it
Moved the option selection statement call outside of the switch, so that after each option, the code breaks out of the switch statement.
Used a boolean flag , so that option selection method is called only for options 1-5 and close the app when 6 is called.
Completed the incomplete codes on the sort , expense search and close app methods.
Application was ran with each and every option and it generated desired output.
The initial code was cloned from simplilearn git hub repo and was added to my git hub account, updated code was also pushed to git hub.
